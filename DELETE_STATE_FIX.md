# State Deletion Fix

## Issue

When a user made a DELETE request for a state, the system would fail with a foreign key constraint violation because the state had related models that referenced it via `state_id`.

## Root Cause

The original implementation directly deleted the state without first removing the related models. Since `state_id` is a foreign key in the models table, this caused a constraint violation.

## Solution

Modified the state deletion process to:

1. **First, delete all related models** - Added `DeleteByStateID` method to `ModelRepository`
2. **Then, delete the state** - Only after all models are successfully deleted
3. **Added proper error handling** - With detailed logging for debugging
4. **Added validation** - Check if state exists before attempting deletion
5. **Enabled auto-migration** - To ensure foreign key constraints are properly created

## Changes Made

### 1. Model Repository (`repository/model_repository.go`)

- Added `DeleteByStateID(stateID uint) error` method
- Added `CountByStateID(stateID uint) (int64, error)` method for logging

### 2. State Repository (`repository/state_repository.go`)

- Added `DeleteModelsByStateID(stateID uint) error` method for convenience
- Added `CountModelsByStateID(stateID uint) (int64, error)` method

### 3. State Service (`service/state_service.go`)

- Modified `DeleteState(id uint) error` method to:
  - Check if state exists before deletion
  - Count and log the number of related models
  - Delete all related models first
  - Delete the state only after models are successfully deleted
  - Provide detailed error messages and logging

### 4. Models (`models/models.go`)

- Added proper foreign key relationship with cascade delete constraint
- Added `State` field to `Model` struct for proper GORM relationship

### 5. Database Configuration (`config/database.go`)

- Enabled auto-migration to ensure foreign key constraints are created

## Usage

The fix is transparent to the API users. The DELETE endpoint `/states/:id` now works correctly:

```bash
DELETE /states/1
```

## Logging

The system now provides detailed logging during state deletion:

- State existence verification
- Count of related models
- Deletion progress
- Success/failure messages

## Error Handling

- Returns specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- Logs all operations for debugging
- Graceful handling of edge cases

## Database Constraints

With auto-migration enabled, the database will now have proper foreign key constraints that enforce referential integrity.
